How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	By reducing the number of comparisons I had to make manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	By allowing me to find errors or undo some modification.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	By manually commiting I can have fewer versions to search for info and compare, but I can also have too many modifications from one version to the other making it more difficult to quickly find specific differences.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	To facilitate the versioning of a set of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log shows the history of commits with frases used to describe the change.
	git diff shows the added and deleted lines when comparing two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	By making sure that a previous working version is not lost. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Not sure yet.
