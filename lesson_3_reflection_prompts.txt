When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I work on a project with other people.
	When I want to share my project publicly to other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To allow me to work on my local copy of a branch without worrying about it being automatically modified by changes made by other people working on the remote repository.
